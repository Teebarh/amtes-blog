_Babatunde Bisiriyu’s journey in engineering is a story of passion, hard work, and curiosity. From studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Gateway Polytechnic to graduating with a first-class degree in Mechatronics Engineering from FUNAAB, he has always been eager to learn and push his limits._

_For over five years, Babatunde has shared his love for math and science by tutoring students in Nigeria and beyond. But his interests go beyond teaching. He is deeply fascinated by robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and virtual reality. He sees engineering as a way to bring ideas to life and create real solutions to everyday problems._

_In this interview, the first in our AMTES Alumni Series, Babatunde talks about his journey, the challenges of studying engineering in Nigeria, and his hopes for the future of technology._

**Hello, Babatunde! Good afternoon. I’m Toyibat, as you already know, from the AMTES writer team. I hope you’re having a good day so far?**

Hi Toyibat, Good afternoon. I am doing very good, thank you. I trust you're having an awesome day too.

**Yes, I am😊. Thank you for agreeing to do this and sharing your experience in the department with us. I have between 5 to 7 questions for you today.**

It is a pleasure. The Mechatronics Engineering department, Funaab is my home. Shoot please.

**Thank you. I’ll start off by asking, what motivated you to study Mechatronics Engineering?**

Right after secondary school, I was an apprentice at an automobile mechanic workshop. I learnt the rudiments of vehicle operations and I was fascinated by the engineering behind vehicles. I went on to Gateway Polytechnic, Ogun state, to study Electrical and Electronics at the national diploma level and I wanted to combine the knowledge of electronics with cars, and Mechatronics engineering seemed like the right option. So, instead of going back for a Higher National Diploma, I opted to study mechatronics engineering at Funaab.

**Oh wow! I also had an interest in automobiles, although that has evolved into a love for airplanes and I’m looking to explore that field.**

You should absolutely do it. Passion is one of the most important things that keeps one going in engineering.

**One thousand percent! How would you rate your study experience? Did you get the results you came in seeking?**

Study experience is a 100 for me. At the beginning, I wasn't hitting my result goals because I had a first-class result (4.78/5) only once out of the first 5 semesters. The tides changed when I hit a perfect GPA in 300 level second semester, and it took my GPA to a first-class. That moment changed everything.

Did I get the result I came seeking? Absolute YES. It was first class or nothing. So, I got it.

**What were some of the things you did differently that you feel helped you hit a perfect GPA and maintain a first class CGPA?**

It might sound unconventional but it started with ensuring financial stability. I redefined my study pattern also, and ensured not to miss classes. I worked with past papers more often, and I wrote a watchword, _(JUST DO IT),_ on my board at home to serve as a reminder, and motivation that my dream was valid and doable.

**I can see how this helped keep you motivated and consistent. Congratulations on hitting your goal! It must not have been easy.**

Thank you Toyibat. It wasn't easy but it was worth the tussle.

**Most definitely. What are some of your plans post graduation? Do you plan to go to grad school and pursue your passion for automobiles or get into the industry straight away?**

I have a great passion for teaching/lecturing. I'll definitely explore the graduate school option. I hope to redefine the scope of engineering within my environment by helping students understand that a perfect blend of academics and industry knowledge will elevate them beyond the stars. So, graduate studies then industry (to garner required experience) and then back to the classroom as a lecturer.

**This is beautiful. Your students would be lucky to have you. I really hope you achieve this.**

Thank you, Toyibat. I'll put in my best to do so. I'm teaching anyway, so I'm big on making academic impacts.

**You’re welcome! From what I know, applying to grad school requires getting recommendation letters and maybe even a bit of research experience. How did you work towards that in school while also dealing with academics?**

Oh. This is an interesting question. I started making research on what it entails to apply for graduate studies post COVID so I ardently follow content from people like [Dr. Igbalajobi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olumuyiwa-igbalajobi/), and a host of others. I read about walking up to a lecturer in your department to help out on research works to gain research experience. I applied the knowledge and I approached the current HOD of the department. He took me in and we worked on many research projects together. I now have my name listed as a contributor in about 7 publications, including two publications made off my final year project.

**Oh wow, this is impressive!**

Working towards it was quite stressful, but I was hellbent on making it count, so I devised a schedule where the bulk of the research-related activities get executed on weekends. The HOD is an awesome person so he was quite accommodating when it came to delays in my deliverables.

**So you started working towards it at say 200 level?**

No, 300 level. The first task was given in 400 level.

**Oh oh. I’m looking to go to grad school as well so your response has been really helpful.**

That will be awesome. Look into it. Add volunteering experiences if possible. It will be an amazing journey overall.

**I’ll make sure to, thank you so much!**

I wish you the best of luck Toyibat.

**Thank you so much, Babatunde. We’re almost at the end with two more questions to go. For my 6th question, I’d like to ask, how did you manage everything you had going on and avoid getting burnt out? If you did get burnt out, how did you navigate that?**

I already understood the concept of burning out because I already worked as a classroom teacher before resuming Funaab. I had less burnout experience because I was doing things that I really wanted to do. On a few occasions when I feel uninterested, I still have a decent social life. I watch football games, go to parties with friends and randomly visit home. So, I didn't really experience burnout.

**Mmmm, this makes so much sense. Okay, for the final question, what advice do you have for anyone looking to take similar steps as you and go into grad school or looking to graduate with a first class?**

You have to understand that people try to shit on what they can't achieve because it is a reflection of their inability when they see you achieve it. Academic excellence, even if it doesn't translate to financial growth, is still not less of an excellence. We are in a dysfunctional society and people will ask you many times “who first-class help?” but if you want it so much, shield your mind from naysayers and keep doing your thing.

Here’s my advice:

- Academics is tough, brace up for impact.
- Keep people that have the same aspirations as you as friends.
- Your dreams are valid, but on days when it is seeming impossible, retreat and strategize. Don't be deterred.
- Don't leave it late. Start early
- Your lecturers are not your enemies. Build quality relationships with them while maintaining mutual respect.

**👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾. Thank you for these wonderful gems.**

You’re welcome. It’s a great pleasure doing this with you.

Likewise! Thank you so much for your time! I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.

You too. Have an awesome day. Cheers!🎉

**Thank you!💃🏾💃🏾**
